Introduction
This guideline is to aid monitoring for adverse effects during the treatment of MDR-TB.  It is not a treatment guide or a guide for monitoring the progress of treatment.  For treatment guidance please refer to the WHO treatment guideline and the BTS MDR-TB Clinical Advisory Service.  Treatment of MDR-TB should always be undertaken in consultation with local experts as well as published guidance.
Due to the complexity of treatment regimens and comorbidity associated with the disease itself, more frequent monitoring may be needed in individual patients and this should be guided by the clinician in charge of the patient’s care.  Our recommendations are predominantly based on consensus opinion from TB physicians, pharmacists, nursing staff and specialties including audiology and ophthalmology and drug advisory organisations including the FDA and BNF.
We also appreciate that most patients with MDR-TB are established on treatment whilst an in-patient and may require more frequent blood test monitoring during the initial phase of treatment.  We have produced this document to provide advice on the frequency of monitoring which should occur, at minimum, in all patients on MDR-TB treatment.
All recommendations below should cover any combination of drugs.  Where additional monitoring is required with a specific drug we have noted this and provided a source for further information in the form of individual drug monographs.
Therapeutic drug level monitoring advice is available in individual drug monographs.

Full blood count (FBC), clotting

HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C


Other Tests
ECG

Visual Acuity and Colour Vision

Audiometry

Nutritional Assessment
ONGOING MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS
FBC
Monthly until 6 months. Consider reducing frequency after 6 months if stable and no changes to medication. If using Linezolid please see individual drug monograph for FBC frequency recommendations.
Clotting
Baseline and repeat if indicated, particularly if deranged LFTs.
U&Es
	
All MDR patients should be on an aminoglycoside therefore:
Month 1 = twice weekly
Month 2 = weekly
Month 3 onwards: fortnightly
Consider reducing to monthly after cessation of treatment with aminoglycoside, if renal function remains stable.
Consider increasing frequency of monitoring if evidence of renal impairment.
LFTs
Weekly for the first month or until regimen is established, whichever is longest.  Then to continue monthly throughout treatment.  Consider reducing frequency after 6 months if LFTs stable and no pre-existing liver disease or changes to medication.
Calcium
Monthly until 6 months. Consider reducing frequency after 6 months if stable and no changes to medication.
TFTs
Monthly if patient on prothionamide and PAS combination therapy.  If on only prothionamide or PAS, check TFTs 3 monthly.
Magnesium
Monthly until 6 months. Consider reducing frequency after 6 months if stable and no changes to medication.
Uric Acid
Baseline only unless evidence of gout or baseline levels high.
ECG 
(For patients prescribed macrolides, fluoroquinolones, clofazamine or bedaquiline)
Baseline, at 2 weeks, then 3 monthly throughout treatment.
Repeat if symptomatic or after the addition of any new medication which is known to prolong QT.
Be particularly cautious when prescribing more than one drug which might prolong QTc such as ondansetron, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics etc.
Refer to EP Cardiologist if QTc outside normal range.
Visual acuity & Colour Vision
6 monthly or more frequently if symptoms noted
Audiometry
Monthly until completion of treatment and a final test 2 months after treatment completion.





DRUG MONOGRAPHS
	
AMIKACIN

Please note amikacin is not licensed for the treatment of tuberculosis in the UK.

DOSAGE
For intramuscular or intravenous administration only.  (Intravenous route is preferred, as the volume of doses required would necessitate two IM injections each day.)

Amikacin is usually given once daily (although for pragmatic reasons there is experience giving it 5 days per week) for an initial period (usually at least two months).  In clinical practice the frequency is usually then reduced to three times weekly.

Single-Dose Regimen (usually as an intravenous infusion, diluted in 100mL sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 5% and infused over 30 to 60 minutes):
Adults: 15mg/kg daily (usual maximum 1g daily, but can be increased if necessary in large muscular adults).  After initial period (usually at least two months): 15mg/kg three times per week.
Age >59 years: 10mg/kg daily (maximum 750mg daily).  After initial period: 10mg/kg three times per week.

Renal failure: 12-15mg/kg TWO to THREE times a week.  Please discuss with a pharmacist. 

Obesity: It has been suggested that markedly obese patients should have an adjusted dose using ideal body weight plus 40% of the excess weight in markedly obese patients. The adjusted dose is due to the decreased distribution of extracellular fluids in adipose tissues.
Ideal body weight (men): 50 kg plus 2.3 kg/inch over 5 ft.
Ideal body weight (women): 45 kg plus 2.3 kg/inch over 5 ft.
Adjust dose and/or frequency according to serum amikacin concentration (see below).

Children: 15-30mg/kg daily (usual maximum 1g daily). After initial period: 15-30mg/kg three times per week.
Adjust dose and/or frequency according to serum amikacin concentration (see below).

PREPARATIONS
Parenteral: 100mg/2mL, 500mg/2mL injection.

DRUG LEVEL MONITORING
Indications for monitoring:
Ensure therapeutic dose.
Ensures that accumulation is not occurring in renal impairment.
Target Level:	<5mg/L (trough)
25 – 35mg/L (peak)
Timing of sample: 	
Pre dose.
Take a level 90 – 120 minutes and 6 hours after the infusion ends. Then plot on semi-logarithmic paper and extrapolate back to time = 0.
Alternatively, taking a level 60mins after infusion ends may be appropriate as a measure of the peak level, but may underestimate the true peak level.
Frequency of Levels: 
Peak serum level in first week, repeat if poor response. 
Trough serum levels weekly for 4 weeks.  This can reduce to fortnightly when stable.
Suggested Actions:	
Trough level: High – extend interval.
Peak level: High – reduce dose; low – increase dose.

ADVERSE EFFECTS
COMMON:
Nephrotoxicity: Accumulation if renal impairment.
Ototoxicity: Irreversible vestibulo-cochlear nerve damage. 
SERIOUS:
Endocrine: Hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hypokalaemia.
Neurological: Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis (more common in neuromuscular disease; usually dose-related and self-limiting).
Audiological: Ototoxicity - auditory > vestibular (higher with prolonged use and older age)
Renal: Nephrotoxicity (higher with prolonged use).

ADVERSE EFFECTS: MONITORING
Renal, auditory and vestibular monitoring is essential
Renal function: Month 1 = twice weekly.
Month 2 = weekly.
Month 3 to end of treatment = fortnightly.
Consider reducing to monthly after cessation of treatment with aminoglycoside, if renal function remains stable.
Consider increasing frequency of monitoring if evidence of renal impairment.

Loss of hearing usually occurs first and is detected by regular audiometric testing. Vertigo, loss of balance and auditory disturbances are also signs of ototoxicity. Ototoxicity on audiogram is defined as a 20 dB loss from baseline at any one test frequency or a 10 dB loss at any two adjacent test frequencies.

We recommend that patients have baseline audiometry and then monthly reviews until treatment with aminoglycoside ceases.  A final audiometry review should be offered 2 months after the final dose.

Routine tests as per generic MDR-TB drug monitoring guidelines. (hyperlink)

INTERACTIONS
Increased risk of ototoxicity if given with: loop diuretics
Increased risk of hypocalcaemia with bisphosphonates.
Increased risk of nephrotoxicity if given with: capreomycin, cephalosporins, ciclosporin, colistimethate sodium, tacrolimus. 
NB: There is no clinical benefit in prescribing amikacin AND capreomycin or kanamycin or streptomycin.

This information is not inclusive of all drug interactions. Please discuss with a pharmacist. 

CONTRA-INDICATIONS & CAUTIONS
Contraindications: 
Hypersensitivity: To amikacin or other aminoglycosides.
Myasthenia Gravis: As amikacin may impair neuromuscular transmission.
Pregnancy: Risk of vestibular or auditory nerve damage to foetus if used in second or third trimester.

Cautions:
Obese: Use ideal weight for height to calculate dose and monitor serum amikacin levels closely.
Elderly: Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity common in the elderly; monitor and reduce dose if necessary.
Renal Disease: Use with caution. Reduce the frequency of dosing and monitor serum concentrations.

High Peak Level: Reduce dose if level >35mg/L.  If level is 35 to 50mg/L, consider reducing dose by 25% per day. If level >50mg/L, consider halving the dose. Recheck level after four days.
Low Peak Level:  Increase dose if level <15mg/L.
Trough levels: Cyloserine absorption may be slow and consequently a 2-hour peak level may not capture the true Cmax.  It is rare to see elevated peak levels in the absence of elevated trough levels, therefore a raised trough level may indicate potentially toxic ‘true’ peak levels.  Consider serial peak serum level assays (e.g. at 2, 4 and 6 hours post dose), and dose reduction.

ADVERSE EFFECTS
COMMON:
Neurological: Confusion, disorientation, dizziness, somnolence (increased risk if peak serum level >35mg/L).
SERIOUS:
Cardiovascular: Sudden development of congestive heart failure (rarely reported at doses greater than 1 to 1.5g daily).
Dermatological: rash and photosensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare).
Psychiatric: Depression, seizure, psychotic disturbances (increased risk if peak serum level >35mg/L).

Target Level:	3 – 5mg/mL (Peak).
Timing of sample: 
2 hours post dose.
Repeat at 6 hours if suspect delayed absorption.
Frequency of Levels: 
Drug levels need not be routinely measured.

Adherence Monitoring
INH strips can be used to measure adherence to isoniazid treatment.  
BBL Taxo INH Test Strips are absorbent paper strips that colour green, blue or purple in the presence of isonicotinic acid (a metabolite of isoniazid)
BBL Taxo INH Test Control is an isoniazid-impregnated disc that will yield a positive result in the test procedure.

ADVERSE EFFECTS: MONITORING
Routine tests as per generic MDR-TB drug monitoring guidelines. (hyperlink)

INTERACTONS
Carbamazepine: increased plasma concentration of carbamazepine. Increased risk of hepatoxicity.
Food: Reduced absorption. Take isoniazid 30-60 minutes before food, or 2 hours after food.
Food: Possible increased risk of headache, sweating, palpitations, flushing, hypotension when eating certain foods such as cheese, skipjack tuna or other tropical fish, or red wine.  Usually, no dietary restrictions are required unless symptoms are experienced.  This reaction is thought to be due to the high histamine or tyramine content of these foods and drink, resulting in an exaggerated histamine poisoning reaction due to inhibition of histamine metabolism by isoniazid, or the sympathomimetic  action of tyramine due to inhibition of mono-amine oxidase by isoniazid.

P-AMINOSALICYLIC ACID (PAS / PASER®)

Please note p-aminosalicylic acid is not licensed in the UK.

DOSAGE
Adults: 150mg/kg/day in two to four divided doses (oral).  Usual dose is 8-12g per day.
Children: 200-300mg/kg/day (max. 10g per day) in two to four divided doses (oral).

The Paser® brand of p-aminosalicyclic acid should be prescribed, since these have an acid-resistant coating, preventing stomach gastric acid from degrading the drug to m-aminophenol, a known hepatotoxin. The enteric coating therefore prevents acid degradation of the drug in the stomach, and releases the drug in the small intestine where neutral pH causes fast dissolution of the enteric coating.

The granules of p-aminosalicyclic acid should be sprinkled on to an acidic food such as applesauce or yogurt, or mixed in acidic juices such as tomato, grape, grapefruit, cranberry, apple, or orange. The granules must not be chewed, and must not be mixed with neutral pH food or drink.

Take p-aminosalicyclic acid with food to reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects.

P-aminosalicyclic acid is only available in 4g sachets. In order to give part of a sachet, flatten out the packet, so that the granules are spread evenly in the packet.  Cut the packet to the approximate dose required – i.e. cut into halves for 2g doses, and into quarters for 1g doses. Discard the remaining unused portions of the packet.

PREPARATIONS
Oral:	4g granules per sachet (unlicensed medicine).

DRUG LEVEL MONITORING
Drug levels need not be routinely measured.

ADVERSE EFFECTS
COMMON:
Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain.
Immunological: Hypersensitivity reactions (5-10%) including rash & fever.
SERIOUS:
Metabolic: Hypothyroidism.
Haematological: Haemolytic anaemia (patients with G6PD deficiency), agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leucopaenia, and thrombocytopaenia.
Hepatic: Acute hepatitis (rare).

ADVERSE EFFECTS: MONITORING
TFTs: 3 monthly (if being given in combination with prothionamide, increase to monthly)
Routine tests as per generic MDR-TB drug monitoring guidelines. (hyperlink)

INTERACTONS
Antacids: Fast dissolution of acid-resistant coating, resulting in early release of p-aminosalicyclic acid into the stomach. However as the stomach gastric acid will have been neutralised, degradation of p-aminosalicyclic acid to m-aminophenol will not occur. No dose adjustments required, however administration of p-aminosalicyclic acid in acidic food or drinks is not required.
Digoxin: Possible decrease in digoxin absorption. Monitor digoxin serum concentrations. 
Prothionamide: increased risk of hypothyroidism, possible increased risk of hepatoxicity.
Rifamycins: reduced absorption of rifamycins. Give 8-12 hours apart.

This information is not inclusive of all drug interactions. Please discuss with a pharmacist. 

CONTRA-INDICATIONS & CAUTIONS
Contraindications: 
Hypersensitivity: To p-aminosalicylic acid, or to aspirin.
Renal Disease: Manufacturer advises to avoid in severe renal failure, as an inactive metabolite is renally excreted.  May worsen acidosis and/or crystalluria in severe renal failure.

Cautions:
Pregnancy: Use in pregnancy has not been studied/
Breast-feeding: P-aminosalicylic acid is secreted into breast milk at 1/70th of the maternal plasma concentration.

STREPTOMYCIN

Please note streptomycin is not licensed in the UK.  
Streptomycin is not usually recommended for the treatment of MDRTB, as half of UK cases are resistant to streptomycin.

PREPARATIONS
Parenteral: 1g powder for reconstitution for injection (unlicensed medicine).

DOSAGE
For intramuscular administration only. There is experience of using streptomycin as an intravenous infusion, but the prescriber should ensure the streptomycin preparation used is suitable for intravenous administration.
Streptomycin is usually given once daily for an initial period (usually at least two months), then the frequency may be reduced to three times weekly.  

Adults: 15mg/kg daily (usual maximum 1g daily, but can be increased if necessary in large muscular adults).  After initial period: 15mg/kg three times per week.
Age >59 years: 10mg/kg daily (maximum 750mg daily). After initial period: 15mg/kg three times per week.

Renal failure: 12-15mg/kg TWO to THREE times a week.   Please discuss with a pharmacist. 

Obesity: Use ideal body weight plus 40% of the excess weight in markedly obese patients. The adjusted dose is due to the decreased distribution of extracellular fluids in adipose tissues.
Ideal body weight (men): 50 kg plus 2.3 kg/inch over 5 ft.
Ideal body weight (women): 45 kg plus 2.3 kg/inch over 5 ft.
Adjust dose and/or frequency according to serum streptomycin concentration (see below).

Children: 15mg/kg daily (usual maximum 1g daily). After initial period: 15mg/kg three times per week.
Adjust dose and/or frequency according to serum streptomycin concentration (see below).

DRUG LEVEL MONITORING
Indications for monitoring:
Ensure therapeutic dose
Ensure renal clearance, especially in at risk patients (e.g. renal impairment, elderly)

Target Level:	<5mg/L (trough)
25 – 35mg/L (peak)
Timing of sample: 	
Pre dose
60mins after infusion ends
Frequency of Levels: 
Peak serum level in first week, repeat if poor response. 
Trough serum levels weekly for 4 weeks, fortnightly for 4 weeks, then monthly if stable
ADVERSE EFFECTS
COMMON:
Nephrotoxicity: Accumulation if renal impairment.
Ototoxicity: Irreversible vestibulocochlear nerve damage. 
Hypersensitivity skin reactions: Rashes, urticaria, erythroderma.
Drug-induced eosinophillia (Usually subsides with intermittent dosing).
SERIOUS:
Endocrine: Hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hypokalaemia 
Immunological: Anaphylaxis (uncommon).
Neurological: Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis (more common in neuromuscular disease; usually dose-related and self-limiting).
Audiological: Ototoxicity - auditory > vestibular (higher with prolonged use and older age).
Renal: Nephrotoxicity (higher with prolonged use).

ADVERSE EFFECTS: MONITORING
Renal, auditory and vestibular monitoring is essential

Renal function: Month 1 = twice weekly
Month 2 = weekly
Month 3: End of treatment with an aminoglycoside = 2 weekly
Consider reducing to monthly after cessation of treatment with aminoglycoside, if renal function remains stable.
Consider increasing frequency of monitoring if evidence of renal impairment.

Loss of hearing usually occurs first and is detected by regular audiometric testing. Vertigo, loss of balance and auditory disturbances are also signs of ototoxicity. Ototoxicity on audiogram is defined as a 20 dB loss from baseline at any one test frequency or a 10 dB loss at any two adjacent test frequencies.

We recommend that patients have baseline audiometry and then monthly reviews until treatment with aminoglycoside ceases.  A final audiometry review should be offered 2 months after the final dose.
Routine tests as per generic MDR-TB drug monitoring guidelines. (hyperlink)

INTERACTIONS
Increased risk of nephrotoxicity if given with: capreomycin, cephalosporins, ciclosporin, colistimethate sodium, tacrolimus
Increased risk of ototoxicity if given with: loop diuretics
Increased risk of hypocalcaemia with bisphosphonates.

This information is not inclusive of all drug interactions. Please discuss with a pharmacist. 

CONTRA-INDICATIONS & CAUTIONS
Contraindications: 
Hypersensitivity: to streptomycin or other aminoglycosides
Myasthenia Gravis: as aminoglycosides may impair neuromuscular transmission
Pregnancy: Risk of vestibular or auditory nerve damage to infant if used in second or third trimester

Cautions:
Obese: Use ideal weight for height to calculate dose and monitor serum streptomycin levels closely
Elderly: Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity common in the elderly; monitor and reduce dose if necessary
Renal Disease: Use with caution. Reduce the frequency of dosing and monitor serum concentrations.
